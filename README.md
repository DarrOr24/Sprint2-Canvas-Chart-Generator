**Chart Generator Project**

This project was the second in my Coding Academy journey, where we learned how to work with the HTML Canvas element. It was built using only vanilla JavaScript, with no external libraries or frameworks like React. The goal was to deepen our understanding of rendering graphics on the web through Canvas, and creating interactive chart visualizations from scratch.
